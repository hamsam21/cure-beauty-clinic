              <p class="dark-grey-text">A clinic (or outpatient clinic or ambulatory care clinic) is a healthcare 
              facility that is primarily focused on the care of outpatients.
               Clinics can be privately operated or publicly managed and funded.
                They typically cover the primary healthcare needs of populations in local communities,
                 in contrast to larger hospitals which offer specialised treatments and
                  admit inpatients for overnight stays.

              <p class="dark-grey-text">A beauty salon, or beauty shop, is an institution that deals with 
              beauty treatments for men and women. Other forms of this type of business include hair salons and spas.

               although many small companies offer two sets of treatments..
